How to Use:

1. Import img_src

*IMPORTANT, This is written in python2*

2. use the get_image command, which takes a string (the phrase or definition you're trying to lookup).

3. The command will download the image and save it in a local directory, then it will return the path of said image for future use.

*Note: Currently it has a main function that will automatically gnerate a result for get_image("raining heavily"), delete it for your implementations*
